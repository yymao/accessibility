# Images and Alt Text

All images, either standalone or embedded in a document or slide deck, need to have alternative text (commonly called "alt text") that describes the content and function of the image.

:::{tip} Avoid images of text
Avoid using images of text (e.g., a screenshot of a text paragraph) to convey information.
Instead, use actual text whenever possible.

## General Guidelines for Writing Good Alt Text

- **Be concise**: Summarize the content and function of the image with a few short sentences. *Avoid* starting the alt text with "Image of..." or "Picture of...".
- **Provide context**: Describe what information the image conveys in the specific context of the document.
- **Emphasize function**: For complex images (e.g., charts and graphs), provide a brief summary in the alt text that highlights the key takeaway (that is, the function of this image).

If an image is purely decorative and does not convey any information, you can simply put "decorative" as the alt text.

## Generate Alt Text with AI Tools

Writing alt text takes time. Luckily, AI tools can help generate initial drafts of alt text. You still need to review and edit for accuracy and clarity, but AI tools can save significant time.

Upload the image to an AI chatbot (e.g., ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot).
Note that the image should *not* contain sensitive or private information.
Then, give the AI chatbot a prompt like the following:

> Generate alternative text for the uploaded image. Keep it concise.
>
> (*Optional but recommended*) This image is used in the context of [briefly describe the context or topic, e.g., illustrating coordinate transformation].

After the AI chatbot generates the alt text, review and edit it as needed. **Do not skip this step!**
