# Accessibility in Physics & Astronomy

:::{attention} Work in Progress - Last Updated February 11, 2026
This website is under active development.
If you have any questions, notice any issues, or have suggestions, please contact Yao directly.
:::

This website contains a set of tutorials and practical tips to
improve accessibility of instructional materials that are commonly used
in Physics and Astronomy.

The main goal of this project is to help instructors
in the Department of Physics and Astronomy
at the University of Utah to meet the
[updated Title II and ADA requirements](https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/ "https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/").

:::{hint}
On and after April 24, 2026, all course materials that are provided to students online must meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.1, Level AA standards.
If you are not posting new materials for your Spring 2026 courses after April 24, 2026, you can focus on making your upcoming Summer/Fall 2026 course materials accessible.
