# Videos (Including Audio Recordings)

All videos, including audio recordings, should have closed captions and/or transcripts.
Luckily, Canvas makes it easy to generate captions and transcripts.

## Generate Closed Captions on Canvas

Go to `My Media` on Canvas. If you don't see this option in the course menu,
you can click the avatar icon on the top left corner (right below the U icon),
and you should see the `My Media` option from the dropdown menu.

Use the `Add New` button (on the top right) to upload your video or audio file.
You can also import a YouTube video by selecting `Import from YouTube`.

Once the video is uploaded or imported, closed captions will be generated automatically.
Note that it will take some time to process, depending on the length of the video or audio.

The generated closed captions will also be available to the viewers as a transcript for the video,
you do not need to do anything extra to make the transcript available.

At this point, you have met the minimum requirement of having closed captions available for your video!

## Above and Beyond: Review and Edit Captions

It is recommended that you review and edit the captions for accuracy,
as the automatically generated captions may contain errors, especially for technical terms and jargon.
However, editing captions can be very time-consuming.
And it's important to remember that **imperfect captions are better than no captions at all**.

To review or edit the captions, click on the video in `My Media`,
then select the `Actions` dropdown menu (below the video title on the right side), and choose `Captions`.
