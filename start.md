# Get Started

The Martha Bradley Evans Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) calls out the five focus areas on their [Accessibility Essentials page](https://cte.utah.edu/instructor-education/accessibility-essentials/index.php).
The five focus areas are reproduced below for the sake of convenience and posterity.
The text after ➡️ is added to point readers to the relevant pages on this site.

## Five Focus Areas

1. All images, graphs, and figures included in the course have alternative text available or are marked as decorative.

   ➡️ See [](images.md) for how to write alternative text (alt text).

2. All videos have closed captions and/or transcripts available.

   ➡️ See [](videos.md) for how to add captions and transcripts to videos.

3. All colorful content is high contrast, and color alone is not used to emphasize information (e.g., important text is not indicated by being highlighted in a color).

   ➡️ See [](colors.md) for how to ensure sufficient color contrast.

4. Modules, files, and links used throughout the course have descriptive names (e.g., "Assignment 1" or "Marriott Library", not "Thing.pdf" or "Click Here").

5. Official textbooks, high-quality PDFs (i.e., text is selectable and can be copied/pasted), and/or text-only documents that are compatible with reading assistance software are provided for all readings.

   ➡️ Tips available based on how you generate PDF documents. See the following pages for details:

   - [](latex.md)
   - [](office.md)
   - [](google.md)
   - [](pdf.md)
